# Creating two variables
x = 200
y = 45
# Adding and printing the result
print(x + y) 

# I would use a list for the days of the week (like ["Monday", "Tuesday", ...]).

# I would use an integer data type for the date (like 1, 2, 3, etc.).

# A float is a number with a decimal (like 3.14), while an integer is a whole number (like 5).

# A comment section on a picture on Instagram would be a string (like "nice pic!").

# A survey question asking if someone has traveled would be a Boolean (like True or False).

# 1. More real-life examples to practice code. 
# 2. Extra time to ask questions at the end of class.
# 3. Feedback on my code to know where I can improve.
