Welcome to "Threads & Bites", a creative blend of fashion and food. Our team has developed a unique concept that combines a clothing store with a restaurant. At Threads & Bites, you can shop for Nike apparel and enjoy authentic Chinese foodâ€”all in one place.

What makes us special? We offer more than just a shopping trip or a meal. Our store features the latest Nike gear, from stylish sneakers to casual activewear. After shopping, you can relax and enjoy a delicious meal, with dishes like stir-fried noodles and dumplings, all freshly prepared.

The convenience of combining shopping and dining sets Threads & Bites apart from typical stores and restaurants. Whether you're looking for fashion or food, you can find both here!
