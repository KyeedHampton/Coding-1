#What is a function?

#A function is a set of instruction that performs a specific
#task or job.

#here are two variations of functions in Python 
# Built-in Functions- instructions that are pre-written in python 
# programming  language.

# print() is a built in  function. WHen we pass in data it will output 
# it into the the terminal automtically. 
print('Coding Class')

# input is a built in function. It allows  us  to write and  pass in 
#dat into our program from terminal.
name = input('What is your name?')
print(name)

number= int(input('please provide a number'))
print(23*number)

# User Defined Functions- custom functions written by engineers.

#Function Syntax - how it is written
